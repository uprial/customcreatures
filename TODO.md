# New features
- Limit number of currently living entities by type
- Add a filter based on entity's location: location in the world,
under sun
- Investigate a possibility to move non-despawning entities
and limit their number.
- Unique flag: don't apply two handlers with the same value of this
flag. This flag should replace filter's probability with a system of
 weights.
