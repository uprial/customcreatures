# New features
* Removed the "attack-damage-multiplier" feature due to performance considerations: only 10% of Ghasts have it, which doesn't have any clear effect on the player, and in case of a server reload, the entity loses this buff - but all this machinery spends a lot of server clock.
* Put players in darkness after respawn.
# Bugfixes
* Removed regeneration effect from Zombies and Skeletons because of no effect.
# Balance
* Illusioners may drop a totem of undying.
* Illusioners have much less durable clothes.
