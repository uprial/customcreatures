# ==== General info ====
#
# * You can add your own handlers in this file but don't forget to
# add they into 'handlers' list.
#
# * After editing of this file you need to check server logs to be
# sure that no errors was appeared.
#
# * It's highly recommended to check that your handler
# can modify an entity in the such way. For example, you can't
# set a drop chance for items in hands of a human.
